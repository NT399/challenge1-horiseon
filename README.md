# challenge1-horiseon

## Description

This project involves refactoring the code in CSS and HTML for Horiseon (marketing agency) to ensure it meets accessibility standards and to ensure it is optimised for search engines. 

Semantic structure was employed in the HTML and CSS. Additionally, the code was simplified to ensure it was more understandable. Commentary was added where possible/appropriate to ensure it was more accessible.

From this project I learnt the the different factors that make a website more accessible and how to get the website ready for deployment.
